# Question 24

> Why are IP cores so important nowadays and what is the role of RISC-V in this? How can individuals use it in their SoC system, without giving up on customization?

**IP bridges silicon design gap**.  



# Question 25

> Discuss the [[L7_GAP8.pdf]] processor diagram as an example of bringing together necessary IP blocks towards performant, yet low power SoCs. What blocks, extensions and modifications where introduced to improve performance and power efficiency?

# Question 26

> How can hardware designers make heterogeneous multiprocessing systems based on CPU cores (big.LITTLE) easier to program? How is scheduling and synchronization organized in such systems?

# Question 27

> What are the challenges in running code on truly heterogeneous systems? And what solutions are proposed to alleviate programming truly heterogeneous systems? What challenges remain?
