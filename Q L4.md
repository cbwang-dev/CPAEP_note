# Question 15
 
> How can processors improve energy efficiency as well as throughput by playing with the precision of the MAC unit? Is it also possible to allow runtime precision scaling? How?

# Question 16

> What are the opportunities that come from extreme quantization (binary/ternary/...) in the digital, mixed-signal and memory domain?

1. Digital domain

# Question 17

> What are near- and in-memory processing, and why are not all processors exploiting this? What are the remaining challenges?

# Question 18

> What are the dataflow and algorithmic consequences (opportunities and challenges) of adapting the MAC precision? (also use content of L5 for this question)

# notes

- only for inference then we can use quantization.
