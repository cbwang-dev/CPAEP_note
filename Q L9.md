# Question 32 

> How does Easics limit the required memory bandwidth to internal as well as external memories (at least 3 different concepts are used here). For each of them discuss what kind of layers/networks benefit from this, and where it brings disadvantages?

# Question 33 

> What data reuse and data stationarity does the Easics design exploits, both within one systolic array, as well as across systolic arrays? How to determine the optimal size of a systolic array? (advantages and disadvantages of the different options)

# Question 34

> How does Easics maximally exploits the internal structure of the DSP blocks (explain how following things are exploited: the accumulator chains, the adders before the multipliers, the wide bitwidth of the multipliers, as well as the DSP speed capabilities)?
