Stationarity is for optimizing temporal unrolling. It increase TP and slightly for efficiency. This can be treated as a complement of spatial unrolling ([[TECH parallelization (spatial)]]). 

Below illustrates exploiting stationarity for spatial output reuse baseline. Other methods of spatial reuse can be still exploited.
