#todo double check

arithmetic Intensity (AI) can be described as `throughput(ops/cc) / bandwidth(words/cc)`. Then, a Roofline model can be plotted so that the constraints (memory bounded or computation bound) can be discovered. 

| Arithmetic Intensity | bounded by  |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| low                  | computation |
| high                 | bandwidth   |
